## 🔧 **Practice Tips**

### **Before Starting**
1. **Read carefully** - Understand the problem completely
2. **Plan approach** - Think before coding
3. **Consider edge cases** - Think of boundary conditions
4. **Estimate complexity** - Plan time/space requirements

### **While Coding**
1. **Start simple** - Begin with brute force if needed
2. **Test incrementally** - Test each part as you build
3. **Optimize step by step** - Improve gradually
4. **Handle errors** - Consider invalid inputs

### **After Solving**
1. **Review solution** - Understand why it works
2. **Look for optimization** - Can you do better?
3. **Document learnings** - Note key insights
4. **Practice similar problems** - Reinforce concepts

## 🎉 **Motivation & Mindset**

### **Remember These Principles**
- **Consistency beats perfection** - Solve daily, even if imperfect
- **Learning > Speed** - Focus on understanding, not just solving
- **Pattern recognition** - Similar problems often have similar solutions
- **Practice makes perfect** - Every problem solved makes you stronger

### **Celebrate Progress**
- **Track your streak** - Count consecutive days
- **Note improvements** - See how you get faster
- **Build confidence** - Each solved problem is a win
- **Share achievements** - Commit to GitHub daily
