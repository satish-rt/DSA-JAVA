## ðŸ“… **Week 1: Arrays (Foundation) - 2025-08-13 to 2025-08-19**

### **Day 1 - 2025-08-13** ðŸŽ¯
**Problem**: Two Sum  
**Difficulty**: Easy  
**Category**: Arrays  
**Source**: LeetCode #1  
**Technique**: HashMap, Two Pointers  

**Problem Statement**:  
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

**Example**:  
Input: `nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]`, `target = 9`  
Output: `[0, 1]`  
Explanation: Because `nums[0] + nums[1] == 9`, we return `[0, 1]`.

**Learning Goals**:  
- Understand HashMap usage for O(n) solution
- Practice two pointer technique
- Learn space-time tradeoffs

### **Day 2 - 2025-08-14** ðŸŽ¯
**Problem**: Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array  
**Difficulty**: Easy  
**Category**: Arrays  
**Source**: LeetCode #26  
**Technique**: Two Pointers, In-place modification  

**Problem Statement**:  
Given an integer array `nums` sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same.

**Example**:  
Input: `nums = [1,1,2]`  
Output: `2`, `nums = [1,2,_]`  
Explanation: Your function should return `k = 2`, with the first two elements of `nums` being `1` and `2` respectively.

**Learning Goals**:  
- Master in-place array modification
- Understand two pointer technique
- Practice array manipulation

### **Day 3 - 2025-08-15** ðŸŽ¯
**Problem**: Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock  
**Difficulty**: Easy  
**Category**: Arrays  
**Source**: LeetCode #121  
**Technique**: Greedy, Single Pass  

**Problem Statement**:  
You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `i`th day. You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

**Example**:  
Input: `prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]`  
Output: `5`  
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.

**Learning Goals**:  
- Understand greedy approach
- Practice single pass algorithms
- Learn profit maximization logic

### **Day 4 - 2025-08-16** ðŸŽ¯
**Problem**: Maximum Subarray  
**Difficulty**: Medium  
**Category**: Arrays  
**Source**: LeetCode #53  
**Technique**: Kadane's Algorithm, Dynamic Programming  

**Problem Statement**:  
Given an integer array `nums`, find the subarray with the largest sum, and return its sum.

**Example**:  
Input: `nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]`  
Output: `6`  
Explanation: The subarray `[4,-1,2,1]` has the largest sum `6`.

**Learning Goals**:  
- Master Kadane's Algorithm
- Understand dynamic programming thinking
- Practice subarray problems

---

### **Day 5 - 2025-08-17** ðŸŽ¯
**Problem**: Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted  
**Difficulty**: Medium  
**Category**: Arrays  
**Source**: LeetCode #167  
**Technique**: Two Pointers, Binary Search  

**Problem Statement**:  
Given a 1-indexed array of integers `numbers` that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific `target` number.

**Example**:  
Input: `numbers = [2,7,11,15]`, `target = 9`  
Output: `[1,2]`  
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore, `index1 = 1`, `index2 = 2`.

**Learning Goals**:  
- Practice two pointers on sorted arrays
- Understand binary search concept
- Learn optimization techniques

---

### **Day 6 - 2025-08-18** ðŸŽ¯
**Problem**: Container With Most Water  
**Difficulty**: Medium  
**Category**: Arrays  
**Source**: LeetCode #11  
**Technique**: Two Pointers, Greedy  

**Problem Statement**:  
Given `n` non-negative integers `height` where each represents a point at coordinate `(i, height[i])`, find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container that would hold the maximum amount of water.

**Example**:  
Input: `height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]`  
Output: `49`  
Explanation: The maximum area is obtained by choosing height[1] = 8 and height[8] = 7.

**Learning Goals**:  
- Master two pointer technique
- Understand area calculation
- Practice optimization thinking

### **Day 7 - 2025-08-19** ðŸŽ¯
**Problem**: 3Sum  
**Difficulty**: Medium  
**Category**: Arrays  
**Source**: LeetCode #15  
**Technique**: Two Pointers, Sorting, Duplicate handling  

**Problem Statement**:  
Given an integer array `nums`, return all the triplets `[nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]]` such that `i != j`, `i != k`, and `j != k`, and `nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0`.

**Example**:  
Input: `nums = [-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]`  
Output: `[[-1,-1,2],[-1,0,1]]`  
Explanation: The triplets that sum to zero are [-1,-1,2] and [-1,0,1].

**Learning Goals**:  
- Master three pointer technique
- Handle duplicate elements
- Practice complex array manipulation

## ðŸš€ **Getting Started Today**

### **Day 1 Action Plan**
1. **Read the problem** carefully (Two Sum)
2. **Create file** in `01-arrays/` folder
3. **Use the template** from your guide
4. **Start with brute force** if needed
5. **Optimize step by step**
6. **Test thoroughly** with multiple cases
7. **Document your approach**
8. **Commit to GitHub**

### **Success Tips**
- **Don't rush** - Understanding is more important than speed
